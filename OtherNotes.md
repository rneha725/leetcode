- While implementing the `unordered_map`, if you see keys are limited then you can use a vector. Same goes with the `ordered_map`

- C++ pass by reference
    `string -> const string&`

- When using `INT_MIN` or `INT_MAX` make sure that you are not adding to `INT_MAX` or subtracting from `INT_MIN` from the varible these values are assigned to.

- Always makes sure that the array/vector subscript are taking values in their range.
