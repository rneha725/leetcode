# Random realisations:
- Solving [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-visible-people-in-a-queue/solutions/3424402/number-of-visible-people-in-a-queue-usin-yimn/?envType=company&envId=google&favoriteSlug=google-thirty-days) problem I realised, I need to learn a lot. At least one takaway is, when you are solving questions in which for each element you need some kind of left and right boundary, it could be a good candidate for a stack based problem. For example, in the attacked question, right boundary can be decided as per the elements in the stack and the second boundary could be using the element that pops it.
